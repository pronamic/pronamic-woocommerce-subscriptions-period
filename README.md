# pronamic-woocommerce-subscriptions-period
This "Woo Subscriptions" add-on ensures that a period is saved with each subscription order. The "Woo Subscriptions" plugin itself does not store the subscription period in an order. Without this add-on, it is not clear to webshop owners and customers for what period the subscription order and associated payment was.
