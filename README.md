# Pronamic period information for Woo Subscriptions

This “Woo Subscriptions” add-on ensures that a period is saved with each subscription order. The “Woo Subscriptions” plugin itself does not store the subscription period in an order. Without this add-on, it is not clear to webshop owners and customers for what period the subscription order and associated payment was.

# Accounting programs

Certain accounting programs offer the option to define a period for invoice lines. In this way, an accounting program can automatically distribute the amounts over a period. This can be used for “Prepaid expenses” and “Deferred revenue” on the balance sheet.

## Moneybird

Moneybird is an accounting program with the option to set a period per invoice line:
